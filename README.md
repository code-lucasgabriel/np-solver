# NP Solver

NP Solver is a Python framework designed to tackle complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since finding an exact, optimal solution to NP-hard problems is often computationally intractable, this library provides flexible and easy-to-use implementations of popular metaheuristics to find near-optimal solutions in a practical amount of time.

It includes implementations of GRASP, Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithms, with a modular design that allows for easy extension. This toolkit is ideal for students, researchers, and engineers working on optimization challenges.
