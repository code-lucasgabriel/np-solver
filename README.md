# NP Solver

NP Solver is a Python framework designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since finding an exact, optimal solution to NP-hard problems is often computationally intractable, this library provides implementations of popular metaheuristics to find near-optimal solutions in a practical amount of time.

It includes implementations of GRASP, Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithms.
